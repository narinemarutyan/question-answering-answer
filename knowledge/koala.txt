Koala Information

Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia, known for their
fluffy ears, large noses, and calm behavior. They spend most of their
lives in eucalyptus trees and sleep up to 18–22 hours a day.

Key facts: - Lifespan: 10–15 years in the wild - Diet: Eucalyptus
leaves, which are low in nutrients and require slow digestion -
Behavior: Solitary and mostly nocturnal - Health: Threats include
habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease such as chlamydia

Koalas are unique animals that rely heavily on eucalyptus forests for
survival. Conservation efforts are essential to protect their habitats
and ensure their populations remain stable.
